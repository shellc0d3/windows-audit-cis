# CIS Windows Scanner

A Python-based **Security Configuration Assessment (SCA)** tool designed to check Microsoft Windows systems against **CIS Benchmarks**. It parses `.yml` rule files (with `policy`, `requirements`, and `checks`), executes registry or file-based checks, and generates **detailed** HTML/JSON reports showing pass/fail results and compliance information.

## Key Features

- **Registry Checks**: Reads Windows registry keys/values to validate system settings.  
- **File Checks**: Checks existence or presence of critical files.  
- **Rule-Based**: Loads multiple `.yml` files from a directory; each file can contain many checks.  
- **Detailed Reports**: Outputs a color-coded HTML report and a structured JSON report, including:
  - **Description**, **Rationale**, **Remediation**, **Compliance**, **Condition** for each rule
  - **Pass/Fail** counts and a **score percentage**  
- **CLI Flags**: Easily specify your **rules** directory, **JSON/HTML** output paths, **host/OS** overrides, and an optional **benchmark** name.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+**  
2. `pip install pyyaml` (for YAML parsing)  
3. **Windows OS** (if you plan to run registry checks). On non-Windows systems, registry checks will fail.

## Usage

1. **Clone or Copy** the `CIS-SCANNER` folder onto your Windows machine.  
2. **Open** a terminal or Command Prompt in that folder.  
3. **Install** dependencies: 
`pip install pyyaml`
4. **Run** the scanner: 
`python main.py --rules=./rules/windows --json=./output/scan.json --html=./output/report.html`
- `--rules`: Directory containing `.yml` files (with checks).  
- `--json`: JSON output path (default `./output/scan.json`).  
- `--html`: HTML output path (default `./output/report.html`).  


## Output

- **JSON**: A file (e.g. `report.json`) with a structured summary

- **HTML**A color-coded report (e.g. `report.html`) with pass/fail counts, an optional benchmark name, and collapsible rule details for each check.

## Known Limitations

**Administrator Privileges**  
Some registry checks require elevated privileges.

**Registry-Only Checks**  
Linux or macOS usage is limited; the registry logic won‚Äôt work off Windows.

**File Permissions**  
Currently checks only existence (or ‚Äúmissing‚Äù). For advanced checks (permissions, ownership), you‚Äôd need further enhancements.

**CIS-Scanner Audit Tool** is in an early stage of development.  
The findings generated by this tool should be **manually verified** before taking any action.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not use this tool directly in a production environment without thorough testing.**
